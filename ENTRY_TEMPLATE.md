# Agent Contribution Log

Append a copy of the four sections below for every contribution before a commit
or PR. Begin each appended entry with `## Entry: YYYY-MM-DD — member — task`.
Keep this template and existing entries unchanged. Resolve concurrent append
conflicts by retaining both entries. The validator checks append-only history,
required fields and exact path coverage; reviewers verify truth and completeness.
Earlier failed attempts remain recorded honestly. Publication requires all three
checks in the latest appended entry to pass, plus a fresh run of the actual gates.

## 1. Scope & Objective

- **Target Subsystem:** [e.g., /simulation/src/controllers]
- **Associated Issue/Task:** [e.g., Issue #14 - PID Tuning]

## 2. Structural Modifications

- **Files Modified/Added:** [List exact paths; include deletions and both sides of renames]
- **API/Interface Changes:** [State explicitly if any function signatures or variables changed]

## 3. Local Validation Checklist

- [ ] Executed `python simulation/run.py --headless-check` cleanly.
- [ ] Executed `python simulation/experiments/verify_backend.py` with zero drift.
- [ ] Physics limits (mass, joint constraints) verified against canonical `/assets/`.

## 4. Compute Saving Handoff State

*Provide a concise, 3-sentence summary of the new state here. This is what other
agents will read to save token spend when inheriting this environment context.*

## Entry: 2026-10-01 — Yulai Duan workspace — agent-neutral entry architecture

## 1. Scope & Objective

- **Target Subsystem:** Repository architecture, agent procedures and simulation validation.
- **Associated Issue/Task:** Implement the owner's Entry Architecture Protocol and make it independent of agent vendor or tool.

- `tools/tests/test_gates.py`
- **API/Interface Changes:** Added the shared AGENTS entry protocol, thin CLAUDE compatibility pointer, contribution validator, staged/push hooks, two required simulation commands, asset manifest schema 1 and CI jobs named Entry architecture and Headless physics; no existing simulator code was imported.

## 3. Local Validation Checklist

- [ ] Executed `python simulation/run.py --headless-check` cleanly.
- [ ] Executed `python simulation/experiments/verify_backend.py` with zero drift.
- [ ] Physics limits (mass, joint constraints) verified against canonical `/assets/`.

Validation evidence: fresh Python 3.11.16 environment installed with pinned MuJoCo
3.14.0 and NumPy 2.4.6 on macOS. All 14 regression tests pass, including temporary
fixture repeatability, mass/joint mismatch rejection, missing models, staged
snapshot isolation, branch naming and append-only log checks. Both real physics
commands exit 1 with “BLOCKED: no canonical robot”; no robot physics pass is claimed.
Working-tree and staged-snapshot architecture checks pass for 42 files and 37
changed paths; relative Markdown links, workflow YAML and hook shell syntax pass.
GitHub Actions has not run, and protection remains disabled. Hooks are provided for
installation per clone; shared worktree Git configuration was left unchanged.
Five personal branches exist locally and have not been pushed.

## 4. Compute Saving Handoff State

The repository now has a shared agent protocol, personal branch convention, structured handoff log, validation hooks and a headless CI definition.
Local regression tests pass, while actual robot validation is blocked by the missing canonical model and physical baseline.
Next supply the reviewed model and confirmed reviewer assignments, complete the physics checks, then publish the branch and activate GitHub protection after review.

## Entry: 2026-10-01 — Yulai Duan workspace — publish and enforce on GitHub

## 1. Scope & Objective

- **Target Subsystem:** Shared GitHub contribution enforcement for member branches and forks.
- **Associated Issue/Task:** Owner clarified that the protocol must be installed on GitHub and apply to every contributing agent.

## 2. Structural Modifications

- **Files Modified/Added:** `tools/physics_gate.py`, `tools/check_entry.py`, `tools/pre_push.py`, `tools/tests/test_gates.py`, `tools/README.md`, `.github/workflows/simulation-ci.yml`, `.github/CODEOWNERS`, `.githooks/pre-commit`, `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/setup.md`, `database/md_research/entry-protocol.md`, `database/md_research/team.md`, `agent_skills/git_hygiene.md`, `ENTRY_TEMPLATE.md`.
- **API/Interface Changes:** Added a one-time protocol-only installation gate that closes when the target branch contains the contribution log; external fork branch convention and configurable upstream base; owner review for enforcement changes. Repository settings require both CI jobs and code-owner approval on main, with no bypass actors.

## 3. Local Validation Checklist

- [ ] Executed `python simulation/run.py --headless-check` cleanly.
- [ ] Executed `python simulation/experiments/verify_backend.py` with zero drift.
- [ ] Physics limits (mass, joint constraints) verified against canonical `/assets/`.

The robot baseline is absent, so these boxes remain unchecked. The owner-requested
initial protocol installation is eligible for the explicit bootstrap gate; it
adds no canonical robot or controller and makes no physics validation claim.
All 15 local regression tests pass, including proof that the bootstrap exception
cannot apply after the protocol is installed or when robot assets/controllers
are added. GitHub CI must pass before initial installation; shared protection is
then activated. Subsequent changed contributions require actual physics results.

## 4. Compute Saving Handoff State

The owner requested the protocol on GitHub so every member and fork contributor uses the same rules.
The installation adds required checks, code-owner review and personal branches without claiming a robot validation result.
Supply the canonical model and confirmed specialist assignments next, and preserve the enforced review process for all later changes.
